Design

Page resembles card from design prototype.

    The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact.
    The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items.
    The dots are removed from the animal's list items.
    Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description).
    Uses border around animal’s information.
    Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.
    Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window).

Feel free to customize your information and styles so long as you follow the above rules. For inspiration, you can try playing around with background colors or border radius!

Check out and share designs in the Udacity Discussion Forum!

Awesome! All points in this rubric item are met.
You did well to providing spacing between the card's element (title, image, and information). This makes the card more visually appealing.

The placeholder image and information is replaced with favorite animal image and information.

The image is 300px wide or the image's width is set to 300px.

The image’s alt is relevant to the animal used.

Well done setting the width of the image to 300px. It appropriately fits into the card. You made good use of the alt attribute of the img tag. This gives a good description of the image in case the image is not loaded. :thumbsup:

Student separates HTML from CSS by linking to stylesheet.

HTML code does not include <style> elements or style attributes in the body.

Well done separating your stylesheet from the html code. It makes debugging and reading code really easy.

index.html 3

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

    <meta charset="utf-8">

Awesome

Nice job making use of charset meta tag.This tag is for specifying the encoding of the text on a webpage. Without this tag, a browser may not know to switch to the proper encoding and characters may be displayed as gibberish.

        <img class="image" src="http://newrytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/owl-300x200.jpg" alt="owl">

Awesome

Well done making use of the alt attribute.

A more descriptive text here is very important in case the image fails to load.

    <div class="description">

        <p>The barn owl (Tyto alba) is the mostwidely distributed species of owl and one of the most widespread of all birds.</p>

        <ul>

            <li><span class="bold">Average Lenght</span>: 32 - 40 cm</li>

            <li><span class="bold">Average Life's Span</span>: 4 years</li>

            <li><span class="bold">Habitat</span>: Voles</li>
